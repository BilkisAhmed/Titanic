# Project Title: Cosmic Mystery Solvers - Spaceship Titanic

Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery. The Spaceship Titanic, an interstellar passenger liner launched a month ago, has collided with a spacetime anomaly. Nearly half of the passengers were transported to an alternate dimension. Join us in investigating this celestial enigma!

## Introduction
Explore the project and help us uncover the mysteries behind the collision of the Spaceship Titanic with a spacetime anomaly.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or an equivalent environment
  
## Getting Started
```markdown
Follow these steps to set up the project and start your investigation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Titanic.git
   cd cosmic-mystery-solvers
   jupyter notebook

## Training with SVM
```markdown
In this project, we employ Support Vector Machines (SVM) to analyze and predict patterns related to the cosmic mystery. Learn how to preprocess the data and train an SVM model using our provided Jupyter Notebook: [project_notebook.ipynb](project_notebook.ipynb).
Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the step-by-step guide to interact with the SVM model and contribute to solving the cosmic mystery.
